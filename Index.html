        <h1>My Tech Journey</h1>
        <p>I started my tech journey with the curiosity of how websites worked, and of course because it is a good source of income.
           After learning the basics of HTML, I moved into CSS, and now i'm about exploring JavaScript. Now, i hear JavaScript is tough but guess what, I'm here to conquer.
           I won't say the journey has been too easy so far, i mean there are lots of sleepless nights, lots of battle with network providers in Nigeria and a whole lot of other struggles,
           but i have friends and families who cheer me on. I joined a 15 day code challenge organised by on of my colleague, to enable us code everyday so we can master the Art of Coding, and it's going fine so far. I know i still have a long way ahead, the journey is only just starting but i'm here for it, for all of it.<br><br> I enjoy coding, i get excited to just create something,
           I want to learn more. My journey doesn't end at being a Front-end Developer, I hope to learn Back-end too, I want to be able to build an app, hopefully own a tech company too, I want to be an inspiration to people.  
           I am dreaming and i am dreaming <strong>BIG,</strong> The sky is only my starting point.<br><br>I won't drop the pen without saying <strong>THANK YOU</strong> to GENESYS TECH HUB for this opportunity, And to my colleagues on this journey with me i want to say <strong>See you at the top.</strong>
